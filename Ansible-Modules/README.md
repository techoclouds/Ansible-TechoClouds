## Introduction to Ansible Modules

**What is an Ansible Module?**

Ansible modules are the building blocks of Ansible playbooks. They are small programs or scripts that perform specific tasks on remote hosts. Modules are idempotent, meaning they ensure the system reaches a desired state without making unnecessary changes if the system is already in that state. Modules can be used for a variety of tasks, such as managing packages, files, users, services, and more.

**Why Use Ansible Modules?**

Ansible modules allow you to automate tasks efficiently and consistently. By using modules, you can:
- Manage systems across multiple platforms.
- Ensure configurations are consistent across environments.
- Reduce manual work and errors.
- Simplify complex tasks with reusable components.

## Part 1: Commonly Used Modules

### 1. `ping` Module
- **Purpose:**  
  The `ping` module is used to test the reachability and responsiveness of remote hosts in your inventory. It's a simple way to ensure that your Ansible setup can communicate with the target hosts.

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Ping all hosts
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Ensure all hosts are reachable
        ping:
  ```

- **Running the Playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook ping_hosts.yml
  ```

---

### 2. `package` Module
- **Purpose:**  
  The `package` module manages software packages across various Linux distributions using the system's native package manager. This module is a unified interface for different package managers like `apt`, `yum`, etc.

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Install Nginx
        package:
          name: nginx
          state: present
  ```

- **Running the Playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml
  ```

In Part 2, we'll dive into more advanced modules and techniques.

### 10. `cron` Module
- **Purpose:**  
  The `cron` module manages cron jobs on remote hosts, allowing you to schedule recurring tasks.

- **Preparation Steps:**
  1. **Create a shell script for backup:**
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
     cat <<EOL > /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Performing daily backup"
     # Add backup commands here
     EOL
     chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
     ```

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Schedule a cron job
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Schedule a daily backup
        cron:
          name: "Daily database backup"
          minute: "0"
          hour: "2"
          job: "/usr/local/bin/backup.sh"
          user: root
  ```

- **Running the Playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook schedule_backup.yml
  ```

### 11. `git` Module
- **Purpose:**  
  The `git` module manages Git repositories on remote hosts, allowing you to clone, update, and manage codebases.

- **Preparation Steps:**
  1. **Ensure Git is installed on the remote hosts.**  
     If Git is not already installed, include this in the playbook:
     ```yaml
     - name: Install Git
       hosts: all
       tasks:
         - name: Ensure Git is installed
           package:
             name: git
             state: present
     ```

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Clone a Git repository
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Clone latest code from GitHub
        git:
          repo: 'https://github.com/example/myapp.git'
          dest: /var/www/myapp
          version: master
          update: yes
  ```

- **Running the Playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook clone_repo.yml
  ```

---

### 12. `setup` Module
- **Purpose:**  
  The `setup` module gathers facts about remote hosts, providing detailed information that can be used within playbooks. This module is automatically called by Ansible, but you can use it explicitly to gather facts at specific points.

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Gather facts about remote hosts
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Gather all facts
        setup:
  ```

- **Running the Playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook gather_facts.yml
  ```

---

### 13. `debug` Module
- **Purpose:**  
  The `debug` module prints statements during playbook execution, helping with debugging and providing informative outputs.

- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Display a debug message
    hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Display a simple message
        debug:
          msg: "Deployment completed successfully!"
  ```

- **Running the Playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook display_message.yml
  ```

## Using Ansible Modules in an Ad-Hoc Way (Without Playbooks)

Ansible allows you to execute modules directly from the command line in an ad-hoc fashion. This is useful for performing quick tasks on remote hosts without creating a playbook. The basic syntax for running an ad-hoc command is as follows:

```bash
ansible <host-pattern> -m <module-name> -a "<module-options>"
```

### 1. `ping` Module
**Purpose:** Test the reachability and responsiveness of remote hosts.

**Example:**
```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

### 2. `package` Module
**Purpose:** Manage software packages on remote hosts.

**Install Nginx:**
```bash
ansible all -m package -a "name=nginx state=present"
```

**Remove Nginx:**
```bash
ansible all -m package -a "name=nginx state=absent"
```

### 3. `file` Module
**Purpose:** Manage file and directory properties on remote hosts.

**Create a directory:**
```bash
ansible all -m file -a "path=/var/www/html state=directory mode=0755 owner=www-data group=www-data"
```

### 4. `copy` Module
**Purpose:** Copy files from the local machine to remote hosts.

**Copy a configuration file:**
```bash
ansible all -m copy -a "src=/local/path/to/config.cfg dest=/etc/my_app/config.cfg mode=0644"
```

### 5. `user` Module
**Purpose:** Manage user accounts on remote hosts.

**Create a user:**
```bash
ansible all -m user -a "name=john state=present groups=sudo"
```

### 6. `service` Module
**Purpose:** Manage services on remote hosts.

**Start and enable Nginx service:**
```bash
ansible all -m service -a "name=nginx state=started enabled=yes"
```

### 7. `command` Module
**Purpose:** Execute commands on remote hosts without invoking a shell.

**Run `whoami` command:**
```bash
ansible all -m command -a "whoami"
```

### 8. `shell` Module
**Purpose:** Execute commands on remote hosts through a shell.

**Check for errors in syslog:**
```bash
ansible all -m shell -a "cat /var/log/syslog | grep ERROR"
```

### 9. `template` Module
**Purpose:** Generate files from Jinja2 templates.

**Deploy Nginx configuration:**
```bash
ansible all -m template -a "src=templates/nginx.conf.j2 dest=/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com mode=0644"
```

### 10. `cron` Module
**Purpose:** Manage cron jobs on remote hosts.

**Schedule a daily backup:**
```bash
ansible all -m cron -a "name='Daily database backup' minute=0 hour=2 job='/usr/local/bin/backup.sh' user=root"
```

### 11. `git` Module
**Purpose:** Manage Git repositories on remote hosts.

**Clone a Git repository:**
```bash
ansible all -m git -a "repo=https://github.com/example/myapp.git dest=/var/www/myapp version=master update=yes"
```

### 12. `setup` Module
**Purpose:** Gather facts about remote hosts.

**Gather all facts:**
```bash
ansible all -m setup
```

### 13. `debug` Module
**Purpose:** Print statements during execution.

**Display a simple message:**
```bash
ansible all -m debug -a "msg='Deployment completed successfully\!'"
```

### Summary
Using Ansible in an ad-hoc manner is powerful for quick tasks and one-off commands. While playbooks are better suited for complex workflows and reusable automation, ad-hoc commands provide a simple and efficient way to manage your infrastructure.
